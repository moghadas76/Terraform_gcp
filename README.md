## About

This repository contains Terraform configurations to manage infrastructure in a reliable, scalable, and reusable way. The project aims to simplify the process of deploying and maintaining resources across various cloud platforms.

## Features

- **Multi-cloud support**: Easily manage infrastructure on AWS, Azure, GCP, or other cloud providers.
- **Modular design**: Reusable modules for efficient infrastructure management.
- **Scalability**: Define and deploy resources that scale based on your application's needs.
- **Version control**: Track and maintain changes to your infrastructure configurations.

## Requirements

- Terraform v1.0.0 or later
- Cloud provider credentials (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Supported operating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux

## Setup

### Install Terraform
Follow the [Terraform installation guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) to set up Terraform on your system.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moghadas76/Terraform_gcp.git
cd terraform-project
```

### Configure Environment Variables
Set up necessary environment variables for your cloud provider:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="your-region"
```
Replace with relevant variables for your provider if not using AWS.

## Usage

1. **Initialize Terraform**  
   Run the following command to initialize the project and download required providers:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Plan Infrastructure Changes**  
   Preview the changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

3. **Apply Changes**  
   Deploy the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Destroy Infrastructure** *(optional)*  
   Tear down the deployed infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```
